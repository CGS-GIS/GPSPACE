The source files in this directory were downloaded from the IERS conventions
center:

Chap7 and Chap9 directories contain the original files and are copied to this
(IERS) directory unchanged, with the exception of: OLOADN.F, which is a
modification of the Chap7/HARDISP.F program, converting it to a subroutine
usable in GPSPACE, and GPT2.F, where the file open/close is managed externally.

Subroutine DEHANTTIDEINEL is called from bodyt.f to compute earth tides.
Subroutine OLOADN is called from gpsppp.f to compute ocean tide loading.
Subroutine IERS_CMP_2015 is called from rderp.f to compute mean pole and
associated pole tide.

For tropospheric mapping and delay initialization,
- subroutine GMF is called from gpsppp.f
- subrouting GPT is called from rdmet.f
- subroutine GPT2 is called from rdmet.f
- subroutines VMF1 and VMF1_INT are called from vmfintrp.f
